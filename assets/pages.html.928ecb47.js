You can embed the value of a variable by writing <b>{ variable name }</b> in the text. For example, in <b>Hello { thing } world!</b>, if the value of the variable (thing) was <b>ai</b>, then the text would become <b>Hello ai world!</b>.</p><p>Variables are evaluated from top to bottom, so you cannot refer to a variable defined below you in a given variable. For example, if there are three variables, <b>A, B, C</b>, that are defined in that order, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> can be referenced inside of <b>C</b>&#39;s definition; however, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> cannot be referenced inside of <b>A</b>&#39;s.</p><p>To receive input from the user, place an &quot;Input&quot; block on the page and set the &quot;Variable Name&quot; to the name of the variable in which you want to store the value (the variable will automatically be created by the block). The variable can the be used to perform actions in response to user input.</p><p>Functions can be used to encapsulate value calculations in a reusable form. To create a function, create a variable of type &quot;Function&quot;. A function can have slots (arguments), and the values of the slots are available as variables within the function. There are also functions called higher-order functions that take another function as an argument. Functions can be predefined or instantiated in-line in slots of such higher order functions.</p>',30);function v(m,k){const t=d("RouterLink");return i(),o("div",null,[l,a("p",null,[p,s(t,{to:"/ko/docs/features/mfm.html"},{default:r(()=>[b]),_:1}),u]),f])}var g=n(h,[["render",v],["__file","pages.html.vue"]]);export{g as default};

Development was started in 2014 by syuilo in Japan. It features an abundance of features such as Drive or Reactions as well as a very high UI customizability.</p><h2 id="history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#history" aria-hidden="true">#</a> History</h2><p>While Misskey started centered around Bulletin Boards as its main feature, the growth in popularity due to the addition of a timeline that let users post short messages and view them in chronological order lead to a gradual shift in the main focus of development towards this kind of functionality. Misskey was not always a decentralized service, but became decentralized through the adoption of ActivityPub in 2018. Since then, it has become a service that is acknowledged and used by many.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><i class="fas fa-info"></i><p>The name &quot;Misskey&quot; comes from a song called &quot;Brain Diver&quot; by a band that syuilo used to listen to at the time called May&#39;n.</p></div><p>With anyone being able to join its development, Misskey is still continually being actively developed.</p><h2 id="what-does-distributed-mean" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-distributed-mean" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What does &quot;Distributed&quot; mean?</h2><p>A <b>Distributed</b> service, also called a <b>Decentralized</b> service, refers to a service which features the division of a community into many servers that all mutually <b>communicate (federate)</b> with each other to share their contents, building a <b>network (Fediverse)</b>. Services for which only one server exists, or for which many independent server exist, are called centralized. Most services fall under the category of centralized, some examples for this are Twitter or Facebook. The advantage of distributed services is being able to select the administration or server theme that suits you freely.It&#39;s also possible for you to make your own server.Thanks to the federated nature, you will be able to access the same community, no matter which server you choose.</p><h2 id="always-open-source" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#always-open-source" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Always Open-Source</h2><p>Misskey has always been, and will always be, open source.Open source means, simply speaking, <b>making the source code of software (a program) publicly available</b>.This also includes being able to adjust or redistribute the source code in its definition. The entirety of Misskey&#39;s source code is <a href="https://github.com/misskey-dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being licensed</a> under an open-source license called <a href="https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/develop/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AGPL</a>, which means anyone can freely inspect, use, adjust, change or redistribute as they see fit. Open source has many merits, including allowing anyone being able to make changes as they like, to make sure the code does not include any harmful components and being able to easily participate in its development. For realizing the distributed nature of Misskey, this concept of open source is indispensable. Using the same example as before, most profit-oriented services like Twitter, Facebook etc. are not open source.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><i class="fas fa-info"></i><p>Technically speaking, Misskey&#39;s source code is being managed via Git, and its repository is being hosted at <a href="https://github.com/misskey-dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub.</a></p></div><h2 id="joining-development-and-supporting-the-project" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#joining-development-and-supporting-the-project" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Joining development and supporting the project</h2><p>If you like Misskey, please support the project.Supporting the project can be done in many ways, with some of them introduced below.Some of these do not require programming skills, so anyone can feel free to support Misskey their own way.We&#39;re always waiting for you.</p><h3 id="adding-features-or-fixing-bugs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#adding-features-or-fixing-bugs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Adding features or fixing bugs</h3><p>If you possess software engineering skills, you can contribute to the project through editing its source code.

Unlike other platforms, Misskey is not grounded in a specific idea (for example, anti-centralization) or vision and being developed with that in mind, so it&#39;s a bit &quot;aimless&quot; in this respect. On the other hand though, this creates a flexibility due to not being bound by a specific direction to go towards.</p><h3 id="is-misskey-being-developed-by-a-company" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#is-misskey-being-developed-by-a-company" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Is Misskey being developed by a company?</h3><p>No.Misskey is being developed by an individual person and not commercialized through connection with any particular company.

This means that, as the development team does not control individual servers, for management-related questions you should contact your server&#39;s administration instead. You can verify who is managing your individual server on <a href="/about">this page</a>.

Development was started in 2014 by syuilo in Japan. It features an abundance of features such as Drive or Reactions as well as a very high UI customizability.</p><h2 id="history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#history" aria-hidden="true">#</a> History</h2><p>While Misskey started centered around Bulletin Boards as its main feature, the growth in popularity due to the addition of a timeline that let users post short messages and view them in chronological order lead to a gradual shift in the main focus of development towards this kind of functionality. Misskey was not always a decentralized service, but became decentralized through the adoption of ActivityPub in 2018. Since then, it has become a service that is acknowledged and used by many.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><i class="fas fa-info"></i><p>The name &quot;Misskey&quot; comes from a song called &quot;Brain Diver&quot; by a band that syuilo used to listen to at the time called May&#39;n.</p></div><p>With anyone being able to join its development, Misskey is still continually being actively developed.</p><h2 id="what-does-distributed-mean" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-distributed-mean" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What does &quot;Distributed&quot; mean?</h2><p>A <b>Distributed</b> service, also called a <b>Decentralized</b> service, refers to a service which features the division of a community into many servers that all mutually <b>communicate (federate)</b> with each other to share their contents, building a <b>network (Fediverse)</b>. Services for which only one server exists, or for which many independent server exist, are called centralized. Most services fall under the category of centralized, some examples for this are Twitter or Facebook. The advantage of distributed services is being able to select the administration or server theme that suits you freely.It&#39;s also possible for you to make your own server.Thanks to the federated nature, you will be able to access the same community, no matter which server you choose.</p><h2 id="always-open-source" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#always-open-source" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Always Open-Source</h2>',9),p=s("Misskey has always been, and will always be, open source.Open source means, simply speaking, "),y=e("b",null,"making the source code of software (a program) publicly available",-1),m=s(".This also includes being able to adjust or redistribute the source code in its definition.

Unlike other platforms, Misskey is not grounded in a specific idea (for example, anti-centralization) or vision and being developed with that in mind, so it&#39;s a bit &quot;aimless&quot; in this respect.

# Favorites

This function allows you to mark a [note](./note) as a favorite.
You can view your favorited notes on the [Favorite](./my/favorites) page.
Other users will not be notified that you have added their note to your favorites, and only you can see your favorites.

To favorite a note, press "Add to favorites" in the note's menu. To un-favorite a note, click "Remove from favorites" in the note's menu.

# Clip

Clip is a feature that allows you to create collections of notes.
The notes can be your own or created by others.

You can also choose to make your clips public to make them available to other users.

To create a clip, click "Add" from the clip management page.

To add notes to a clip, choose the "Clip" option on the note's menu. Then select the clip to add the note to.

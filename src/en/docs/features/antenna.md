# Antenna

Antenna is a feature that allows you to freely set conditions for a custom timeline and automatically collect matching notes.

Antenna conditions can include conditions to include/exclude certain keywords and tags in different combinations as well as other options.
When a note matching an antenna's conditions is posted, the note will automatically be added to that antenna's timeline.

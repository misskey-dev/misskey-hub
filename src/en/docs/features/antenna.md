# Antenna

Antenna is a feature that allows you to freely set conditions for a custom timeline and automatically collect matching notes.

Antenna conditions can include conditions to include/exclude certain keywords and tags in different combinations as well as other options.
When a note matching an antenna's conditions is posted, the note will automatically be added to that antenna's timeline.

To create an antenna, click "Add" in the Manage antennas page. Then fill in the options to customize your antenna.

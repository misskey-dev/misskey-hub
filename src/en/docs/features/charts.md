# Charts

Misskey can generate and display charts for an instance's various federated data sources.
Charts allow you to get a visual depiction of the usage, federation status, and activity of each user.

Instance charts can be viewed from the *instance information* page (accessible by clicking the instance logo in the navigation menu).

Below is a description of each chart and its contents.

## 13.0.0

Released at: 2023/01/16

### TL;DR

- New features (Role system, Misskey Play, New widgets, New charts, üç™üëà, etc)
- Rewriten backend
- Better performance (backend and frontend)
- Various usability improvements
- Various UI tweaks

### Notable features

- Role
  - User policies can be managed more flexibly than before. For example, "instance patrons can create up to 30 antennas," "many users cannot see LTL, but only those who have permission can view it," "it is an invitation-only instance, but any user can invite others," and of course, it is also possible to set up automatic role assignment by combining multiple conditions, such as "Local users and users who have created their accounts less than one day ago are not allowed to make public posts."
- Misskey Play
  - Misskey Play is a new platform that replaces the traditional dynamic Pages. It specializes in dynamic content (applications) and allows for the creation of much more flexible applications than Pages.

### Changes

#### For server admins

- Node.js 18.x or later is required
- PostgreSQL 15.x is required
  - Misskey not using 15 specific features at 13.0.0, but may do so in the future.
- Elasticsearch support has been removed
  - Instead, we envision a mechanism that allows you to set up an arbitrary search provider in the future. With this mechanism, Elasticsearch will still be available.
- Migrated from Yarn to pnpm  
  It is recommended to activate corepack: `sudo corepack enable`
- Instance blocking will now also apply to subdomains
- With the introduction of roles, several functions have been integrated with roles
  - Moderators have been merged into roles. Please keep a record of the moderator list in advance and create a moderator role and reassign it. After the update, the moderator information will be lost.
  - Silences have been merged into roles. It is recommended to record the list of silences beforehand, as previous users will be pardoned.
  - Per-user drive capacity settings have been integrated into roles.
  - Instance default drive capacity settings have been integrated into roles. After updating, please edit the drive capacity for the base role or conditional role.
  - LTL/GTL release status has been integrated into the role.
- Docker is no longer run as root; if you are running Docker and not using object storage, run `chown -hR 991.991 . /files`.

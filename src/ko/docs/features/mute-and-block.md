# 뮤트 및 차단
If you don't like a user, you can mute them to make them disappear from your timelines.
Alternatively, you can block a user to prevent them from seeing your content or engaging with you in any way.
People won't know that you have muted them, but they will know that you have blocked them. It is up to you to decide which option you prefer.

::: 팁
Mute and block can be used together.

In Misskey Web, you can see the list of users you have muted or blocked by going to Settings > Mute & Block.

## Muting
If you mute a user, the following content about that user will no longer appear in Misskey:

- the user's posts (and replies and Renotes to those posts) in the timeline and post search results
- notifications from that user
- message history with the user in Misskey chat
- etc.

To mute a user in Misskey Web, open the menu on the user page of the user in question and press the "Mute" button.

::: 팁
They will not be notified that you have muted them, and they will not know that you have muted them.

## Blocking

If you block a user, they will not be able to see your content and they will not be able to do any the following actions:

- follow you
- add to a user list
- reply or renote
- react or vote in a poll
- send a message
- etc.

Also,

- if the user is already following you when you block them, they will unfollow you.
- if the user already has you in their user list when you block them, you will be removed from that list.

To block a user on Misskey Web, open the menu on the user page of the user in question and press the "Block" button.

::: warning
You will not be notified that you have been blocked, but you will know indirectly that you have been blocked because you will not be able to take any of the above actions, such as following someone.
:::

::: warning
The other person will not be able to see your content, but they will be able to see it if they switch accounts or log out. This is only a simple, but useful feature.

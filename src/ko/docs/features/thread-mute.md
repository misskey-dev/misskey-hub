Thread Mute mutes the thread of a given note. This includes all replies connected to the uppermost note.

If you mute a thread, you will no longer be notified of new replies to that thread, nor will any of the replies mention you.

To mute a thread in Misskey Web, open the menu of any note belonging to the thread in question or the note from which it originated and select 'Mute Thread'.

::: warning
The entire thread will be muted, regardless of which note in the thread the mute operation is performed from.
